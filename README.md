# MoreDyeableArmors
This mod makes a dyeable version of every vanilla armor, ideal for fashionistas!

to-do list:
-add integration for Inspirations and add a dyeable version for some of ArmorPluss armors
-bugfixes and port to 1.13
-do a complete rewrite of the mod, allowing it to be compatible with EVERY mod that adds armors

Note: i would appreciate if anyone could make armor textures for me (dm me on discord for more info :P)
Note: i also would appreciate if you localize this mod for me in form of a pull request
